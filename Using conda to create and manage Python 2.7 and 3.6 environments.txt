# Create multiple python environments to use either Python 2 or Python 3 on the same computer.
# Anaconda works with Python 2.7 or Python 3.6 
# So must use one environment to use Python 2.7 and a different one to use Python 3.6
# NOTE creating new environments takes quite a while as there are a lot of programs/files to create.

# See this website for details on how Python environments work in Anaconda:
https://conda.io/docs/py2or3.html#create-a-python-2-7-environment


### Can create/manage environments either using the cmd line or in the Anaconda Navigator.

## Instructions to create a new environment in cmd line:
<conda create -n ENVIRONAME python=2.7 anaconda>    # sets up a new environment called ENVIRONAME, that's configured to use Python 2.7 and includes all packages based on the anaconda package (=automatically installs all anaconda's dependencies, as anaconda is basically a collection of the most useful packages).
e.g.
<conda create -n py27 python=2.7 anaconda>    # creates an enviro called 'py27' that runs Python 2.7
<conda create -n py36 python=3.6 anaconda>    # creates an enviro called 'py36' that runs Python 3.6

# It's OK to use the default Path C:\Users\User\ (assuming it's been set to C:\Users\User\Anaconda3\Scripts as below)
# If the conda command is not recognised: 
# Go to the ControlPanel\System\Advanced system settings\Environment Variables\Path 
#   Then hit edit and add <C:\Users\User\Anaconda3\Scripts> to the end (this changes the filepath associated with 'Path' in the cmd line).
#   Then restart the cmd line. 


## Instructions to create a new environment in the Anaconda Navigator:
# Start > Anaconda > Anaconda Navigator > Environments
# Click 'Create' to create a new environment: select the version of Python to use and choose an appropriate name (not easy to change it afterwards!). 
# Select 'Not Installed' from the drop-down box above the right hand pane. Check the box by 'anaconda' and click Apply. 
# This lists all the dependencies (packages that anaconda depends on). 
# Click Apply and it will set up the new environment. 


# To rename an environment, e.g. from pythonenv27 to py27, change the directory name at the file location in Windows Explorer:
C:\Users\User\Anaconda3\envs
# NOTE this doesn't seem to rename all the shortcuts to various anaconda programs, so might break the links/filepaths.
# Prob better to just name the file what you want to start with. 

# Anaconda will create a shortcut to all it's files/programs (Jupyter Notebook, IPython, Navigator...) for each environment.
# So there will be a shortcut to "IPython" AND one to "IPython (py27)".
