NOTE from Udacity intro to mach learning lesson 15: evaluation metrics Quiz 27:

     From Python 3.3 forward, a change to the order in which dictionary keys 
     are processed was made such that the orders are randomized each time the 
     code is run. 
     
     This will cause some compatibility problems with the graders 
     and project code, which were run under Python 2.7. 
     
     To correct for this, add the following argument to the featureFormat 
     call on line 25 of evaluate_poi_identifier.py:

         sort_keys = '../tools/python2_lesson14_keys.pkl'

    This will open up a file in the tools folder with the Python 2 key order.
