### Conda: the package manager for Python in Anaconda 
# NB: 'pip' is the package manager for Python if you don't have Anaconda installed
# If you have Anaconda installed, using pip can break your Python installation.
# Use conda (and pip) commands on the cmd line!

# To install a new package:
conda install PACKAGENAME		# enter this on the command line, not in Spyder/Anaconda.
e.g. conda install pyflux

# If it says 'invalid syntax' or the command is not recognised then conda needs updating.

# Conda must be updated via the cmd line using:
>>> conda update conda

# If this command is not recognised: 
# Go to the ControlPanel\System\Advanced system settings\Environment Variables\Path 
#   Then hit edit and add <C:\Users\User\Anaconda3\Scripts> to the end (this changes the filepath associated with 'Path' in the cmd line).
# Note the new path on S2DS laptop was: C:\Users\Client\Anaconda2\Scripts
#   Then restart the cmd line.
