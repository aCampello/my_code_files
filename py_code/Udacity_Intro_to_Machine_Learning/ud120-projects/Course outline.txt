### supervised learning:                
    # discrete: naive bayes, SVMs, decision trees, k-nearest neighbour
    # continuous: regression (outliers, r-squared)

### unsupervised learning:
    # k-means clustering
    # PCA

### data preparation:
    # text processing (text learning)
    # feature scaling (not necessary for decision trees or regression)
    # feature selection
    # PCA to condense many features / identify structure in data
