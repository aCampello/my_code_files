###  """ CLASSES """
# =============================================================================

#  A class is a way to take a grouping of functions and data and place them
#  inside a container so you can access them with the . (dot) operator.

#  Classes are like blueprints for creating objects of a predefined structure,
#  where the created objects are like mini modules.

### Create a new Parent Class:

#  The class name always starts with a capital letter
class Animal(object):
    """Makes cute animals."""  # documentation string for the help page.
    # 'member variables' apply to all instances of the object should go above the _init_:
    is_alive = True  # is_alive is a member variable.
    health = "good"  # health is another member variable.
    # Initialize your newly created empty object using def __init__():
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        # self is first parameter after def __init__(), which tells Python to refer to the object being created - gives it its identity.
        self.name = name  # specifies that 'name' refers to the created object's name.
        self.age = age
    # Add your method here!    # a 'class method' is a function within a class definition.
    def description(self):
        print(self.name)    # to print the name of instance of the object
        print(self.age)


#  Members of a class, e.g. an Animal class, are called instances,
#  e.g. a hippo is an instance of the Animal class.
#  Instances are variables: you instantiate (create) a new object from the
#  class and assign it to a variable (instance), e.g. 'hippo', to work with it.

# Instantiate a hippo instance:
hippo = Animal(name="Harriet", age=7)
hippo = Animal("Harriet", 7)  # can also exclude the labels.

#  Get stuff from classes in the same way as from modules:
import math  # import math module
math.sqrt  # print details of square root function in math module
math.sqrt(5)  # run the square root function from math module

# show hippo's name (assuming there's only one hippo) from Animal class:
hippo.name
hippo.is_alive

# Print hippo's description -this runs the Animal class's description() method.
hippo.description()



###  Create a child class based on a parent class

# The child class inherits variables and methods from the parent class.
#  Create by replacing (object) with (ParentClass) in the class creation code:
#  (Object is the most basic type of class & all Parent Classes inherit from Object; Child Classes will inherit from Object and their Parent Class).

class ChildClass(ParentClass):
    # new variables and functions go here


### The Representation Method - when you're initiating classes.
# use def __repr__() to tell Python how to present the class object.

class Point3D(object):
    def __init__(self, x, y, z):    #  standard class initiation function
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.z = z
    def __repr__(self):             #  representation function
        return "(%d, %d, %d)" % (self.x, self.y, self.z)

my_point = Point3D(x=1, y=2, z=3) #  will represent the object in format (x,y,z).

###  """ CODE FORMATTING """
# =============================================================================

# I've set Preferences to check for IPython Styling so my code is easy for
# others to understand and debug.
# Start comments with a triple hashtag to make them appear in the Outline pane.

Ctrl + # increases font size in the editor

#  Indentation is important: a tab is equivalent to 4 spaces.



### Jupyter / iPython Notebook
# ================================

# https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/notebook/nbformat.html

""" Jupyter (n√© IPython) notebook files are simple JSON documents, containing
    text, source code, rich media output, and metadata. each segment of the
    document is stored in a cell.

    Works like the python interpreter in spyder, but with more menu-driven
    features for annotating code.

    Useful on computers without Python or Spyder installed on the hard drive.

    Open Jupyter Notebook via the start menu or from Git Bash, but if you have
    set up different environments in Anaconda it's best to open it via Anaconda
    Navigator: right click the PLAY button on the environment and open Jupyter
    Notebook from there.

    # best practice is not to have multiple jupyter notebook terminals open/running
    at the same time as can cause problems.

    This opens http://localhost:8888/tree in the web browser and lists all my
    local files.

    Keep Git Bash open on the desktop to keep the browser session connected.
    Can set it to work for Python 2 or 3.

    Click New on top right to create a new Notebook.

    Can drag and drop text or content from desktop programs into cells.

    Set the working directory using cd C:\User\... the same as in Spyder.

    Displays output below the cell containing the code (can toggle output on/off
    or just clear it).

    Can rearrange cells.

    Can tag cells with keywords (new feature April 2017: not yet searchable).

    Can create both code cells and rich text cells to display notes

    Print preview for printing with formatting.

### """ ENVIRONMENTS """
# ===============================================================

# copied from txt file "Using conda to create and manage Python 2.7 and 3.6 environments""

# Create multiple python environments to use either Python 2 or Python 3 on the same computer.
# Anaconda works with Python 2.7 or Python 3.6
# So must use one environment to use Python 2.7 and a different one to use Python 3.6
# NOTE creating new environments takes quite a while as there are a lot of programs/files to create.

# See this website for details on how Python environments work in Anaconda:
https://conda.io/docs/py2or3.html#create-a-python-2-7-environment


### Can create/manage environments either using the cmd line or in the Anaconda Navigator.

## Instructions to create a new environment in cmd line:
<conda create -n ENVIRONAME python=2.7 anaconda>    # sets up a new environment called ENVIRONAME, that's configured to use Python 2.7 and includes all packages based on the anaconda package (=automatically installs all anaconda's dependencies, as anaconda is basically a collection of the most useful packages).
e.g.
<conda create -n py27 python=2.7 anaconda>    # creates an enviro called 'py27' that runs Python 2.7
<conda create -n py36 python=3.6 anaconda>    # creates an enviro called 'py36' that runs Python 3.6

# It's OK to use the default Path C:\Users\User\ (assuming it's been set to C:\Users\User\Anaconda3\Scripts as below)
# If the conda command is not recognised:
# Go to the ControlPanel\System\Advanced system settings\Environment Variables\Path
#   Then hit edit and add <C:\Users\User\Anaconda3\Scripts> to the end (this changes the filepath associated with 'Path' in the cmd line).
#   Then restart the cmd line.


## Instructions to create a new environment in the Anaconda Navigator:
# Start > Anaconda > Anaconda Navigator > Environments
# Click 'Create' to create a new environment: select the version of Python to use and choose an appropriate name (not easy to change it afterwards!).
# Select 'Not Installed' from the drop-down box above the right hand pane. Check the box by 'anaconda' and click Apply.
# This lists all the dependencies (packages that anaconda depends on).
# Click Apply and it will set up the new environment.


# To rename an environment, e.g. from pythonenv27 to py27, change the directory name at the file location in Windows Explorer:
C:\Users\User\Anaconda3\envs
# NOTE this doesn't seem to rename all the shortcuts to various anaconda programs, so might break the links/filepaths.
# Prob better to just name the file what you want to start with.

# Anaconda will create a shortcut to all it's files/programs (Jupyter Notebook, IPython, Navigator...) for each environment.
# So there will be a shortcut to "IPython" AND one to "IPython (py27)".


# ===============================================================
###  """ ERRORS & BUGS """
# ===============================================================

# When running commands make sure to test them thoroughly with different inputs including empty strings '' to avoid edge cases:

The 'edge case' or 'boundary case'	# situation when a variable is an empty string '' that causes an error/bug because there is not character at position 0.
# Always test how functions cope with the empty string to check they are robust.

# get current time
time.clock()
# can use this at start and end of functions to time how long they take to run

# Evaluate some code to see what it does

# ============================================================================

# features = of datapoints, e.g. a point's weight, height, age...
# these notes are in terms of machine learning - from Udacity mach learn lesson 10

""" When different features have vastly different scales, e.g. house age
    vs. house price, features with a larger range can have more influence on results.
    Udacity mach learn lesson 10 vid 8.

    Feature scaling rescales features between 0-1 using this formula:

    X1 = (X - Xmin) / (Xmax - Xmin)

        X1 = the new rescaled feature
        X = the value to rescale
        Xmin and Xmax = the minimum and maximum values from the whole dataset.

    Scaling can be a problem if you have outliers with extreme values.

    Rescaling is only useful for some algorithms:
    It will affect the results of algorithms like SVMs with rbf (non-linear)
    kernels, and k-means clustering, work in multiple dimensions (trade-off
    one dimension against the other).

    Scaling won't affect the results of decision trees, that use vertical/
    horizonal lines to group data (e.g. resizing an image doesn't change it's
    proportions), or linear regression, which calculates independent coefficients
    for each variable that are unrelated to each other).

print my_file.readline()  # running this command again will show the 2nd line.


# Write to file
my_file.write("A string")  # write() function only takes strings
my_file.write(str(num) + "\n")  # str(num) converts num to a string. "\n" means each number is placed on a New Line, e.g. when using with a FOR: statement.

my_file.close()  # MUST close the file after writing for reading the file back, or the changes won't be saved (changes are stored in a temporary 'buffer' file that isn't refreshed until the main file is closed).

# Typical procedure for opening and writing to a file:
# 1. Set working directory where file is saved.
cd C:\Users\User\Documents\S2DS_Bootcamp_2017\Online_course_notes\Udacity_Intro_to_Machine_Learning\ud120-projects\
pwd
# 2. Open the file for reading
read_file = open("text.txt", "r")
# 3. See what's already in the file
print(read_file.read())  # initially it's empty (check in folder though)
# 4. Use a second file handler to open the file for writing
write_file = open("text.txt", "w")
# 5. Write to the file
write_file.write("Not closing files is VERY BADDD.")
# 6. CLOSE THE WRITE FILE
write_file.close()
# 7. Read from the updated file
print(read_file.read())
# 8. Then CLOSE THE READ FILE.
read_file.close()

# Using WITH and AS gets Python to close the file automatically:
with open("text.txt", "w") as my_file:  # saves text.txt as variable 'my_file'
    my_file.write("Some data")          # writes to the file & closes it.

# Check if file is closed
my_file.closed  # will return True if it's closed and False if not.

###  """ FOR LOOPS """
# =============================================================================

# These loop through lists
for <variable_name> in <list>:      # variable_name is a new name introduced in the loop
    <block>
# this syntax means that for each element in the list we assign that element to the variable_name and evaluate the block.


# Loop syntax to refer to multiple variables in a list, e.g. a list of lists
for <variable_name_1>, <variable_name_2>, <variable_name_3> in <list>:
    <block>
# variable names can be anything, (a,b,c, billy,bob,harry...). Only the order matters - as it matches the order in the list.
# Naming variables in lists at the start of the loop saves having to refer to them by index, using i[].

# E.g. to calculate total fees paid at a collection of universities
# uni_list is a list of lists, each contains the uni name, total students enrolled & tutition fees.
def total_enrollment(uni_list):
    total_students = 0                       # create empty variable for running total of students
    total_fees = 0                           # ...and for running total of fees
    for uni, students, fees in uni_list:     # alternative syntax to 'for i in uni_list:'
        total_students += students           # add number of students to the running total
        total_fees += students * fees          # add fees to running total
    return total_fees, total_students


# Return the index position of a certain value, rather than the actual value.
mylist.index(<value>)   # returns the index of the FIRST position where the value is found.
                        # returns an error if the value doesn't exist in the list.

#¬†use enumerate() to loop through lists automatically
# optional argument 1 means start numbering the output list from 1 (default 0)
my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'grapes', 'pear']
for i, value in enumerate(my_list, 1):
    print(i, value)


# =============================================================================
###  """ FUNCTIONS """
# =============================================================================

## Python functions vs Python methods:
# functions work like function(object)
# contrast to methods which work like object.method()
# e.g. len(mylist) vs mylist.count('horse')

## If you update a function in a .py file use reload() in the imp module to
# refresh the function in a notebook that calls that function
from imp import reload
reload(time_series)   # reloads time_series.py without having to reload the kernel.


## Basic in-built functions, e.g. len()

len()    # length
min(1, 2, 3)    # minimum
max()    # max
abs()    # absolute value

+=      # add to (append), e.g. a list or a (running) total
-=      # remove/deduct from, e.g. a list or a total
range(start, stop, step)  # creates/refers to a list, where start defaults to 0 and step defaults to 1.
range(1, 6)  # 1,2,3,4,5 (excludes the STEP number)
range(6)  # 0,1,2,3,4,5 (excludes the START and the STEP numbers - they default to 0 and 1) - can use this to create a list from 0-10 e.g.
my_list = list(range(11))
range(1, 6, 2)  # 1,3,5 (increases in steps of 2)


### More complex functions using def...():

# functions (procedures) take one or more INPUTS (aka 'arguments' / 'operands'), run a procedure and return one or more OUTPUTS
# standard syntax:
def function_name(input1, input2, input3):  # Must include a colon
    """ Docstring - description of what the function does / warning
    - usually split over two lines """
    output1 = input1*input2    # code to run the function/procedure (INDENTED)
    output2 = input1*input3
    return output1, output2    # return one or more outputs separated by commas


# Assign function outputs to a new variable:

# for functions with just one output:
apple = function_name(inputs)

# for a function with 2 outputs, use multiple assignment:
apple, pear = function_name(inputs) # output1 will be assigned to apple; output 2 to pear.


### Programming defensively: assert() to check assumptions in procedures/functions
# Add an assert <testExpression> inside the function code, where if the result is False this invokes a failure and stops the procedure from continuing.
# syntax
assert <testExpression> # if False the procedure is stopped and it prints "AssertionError".
# e.g.
assert date1 < date2 # to check date 1 is less than date2.
assert not date2 < date1 # check date2 is not before date1.

### Helper Procedures
# These check assumptions in code
# E.g. the helper procedure below checks whether date1 is before date2.
def dateIsBefore(year1, month1, day1, year2, month2, day2):
    """ check whether date1 is before date2 """
    if year1 < year2:
        return True
    if year1 == year2:
        if month1 < month2:
            return True
        if month1 == month2:
            return day1 < day2
    return False

### Testing procedures/functions

def test():
    """ test the daysBetweenDates and nextDay functions with various inputs """
    assert daysBetweenDates(2013, 1, 1, 2013, 1, 1) == 0    # =for this input the result should be zero
    assert daysBetweenDates(2013, 1, 1, 2013, 1, 2) == 1    # result should be 1
    assert nextDay(2013, 1, 1,) == (2013, 1, 2)             # result should be (2013, 1, 2)
    assert nextDay(2013, 4, 30,) == (2013, 5, 1)
    assert nextDay(2012, 12, 31,) == (2013, 1, 1)
    print("Tests finished.")

# run the test
test()  # if the tests all pass it returns "Tests finished". If it fails it returns a load of red error text.



###  Anonymous functions

# lambda creates anonymous functions (with no name) that still return values; useful for quick functions but not ones you'll need to use again and again.

# e.g.:
lambda x: x % 3 == 0
# Is the same as:
def by_three(x):
    """ Returns the cube of a given number """  # <-documentation string used in help
    return x % 3 == 0

# Can use lambda functions for filtering:
languages = ["HTML", "JavaScript", "Python", "Ruby"]    # list
print(filter(lambda x: x == "Python", languages))        # filters the languages list to show only items equal to "Python"
# filter() takes 2 arguments, the function that tells it what to filter (e.g. a lambda expression), and the object to perform the filtering on (list).


### Import a function from a different python code file
# set working directory
cd C:\Users\User\Documents\S2DS_Bootcamp_2017\Online_course_notes\Udacity_Intro_to_Machine_Learning\ud120-projects\
import sys
sys.path.append("./tools/")    # sys tells Python where to look; doesn't change the working directory (sometimes you still have to cd into the folder though)
from email_preprocess import preprocess   # imports the function preprocess from the file email_preprocess in the tools folder

""" NOTE if I make changes to the function in the email_preprocess file, might
    need to restart the kernel (and reload in all the data/modules) for the
    changes to be recognised. Otherwise Python will work from the cache. """


# =============================================================================
###  """ HTML & BeautifulSoup
# =============================================================================

# encode a string as utf-8
views_df['content'] = views_df['content'].str.encode('utf-8')

# loops through rows in dataframe column called headline

    soup = bs(line, "lxml")
    line = bs.get_text(soup)
    soup.original_encoding    # to see what the original encoding of 'line' was.


# =============================================================================
###  """ CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS """
# =============================================================================

### IF / ELSE ifelse

# syntax
if <test expression>:   # if the test expression is true, the block (procedure) below will execute.
                        # if it's false, the block won't execute.
    <block>             # the procedure to run if test expression is true (indented).

# example test expressions using if:
if x > y:           # if x is greater than y
if not x > y:       # if x is not greater than y (equivalent to if x <= y)
if not list_1:      # if list_1 is empty

# if-else statement: will do something if the statement is true, or something else if it is false.
# e.g. here, if x is divisible by 5 it will return True, otherwise return False
# (without the else statement it'd return None instead of False):
if x % 5 == 0:
    return True
else:
    return False

# elif statements are to create further if statements, e.g.
if AgeClass == 1:
    return "Adult"
elif AgeClass == 2:
    return "Subadult"
elif AgeClass == 3:
    return "Cub"
else:
    return "Unknown status"


### """ Boolean expressions """
### The 'and' expression
# Returns True only if both expressions are True:
True and True = True
False and False = False
True and False = False

### The 'or' expression
# Evaluates only what it needs to, e.g. for the expression:
<expression_1> or <expression_2>    # if exp_1 is True, exp_2 is ignored and True is returned
                                    # if exp_1 is False, the value of exp_2 is returned. So:
True or True = True
True or False = True
False or True = True
False or False = False


### Decision map dictionaries (the 'dispatch' method)
# http://scottlobdell.me/2014/05/time-efficiency-statements-vs-python-dictionaries/
# https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/182093/why-store-a-function-inside-a-python-dictionary
# much cleaner and faster than having many if statements inside a function.

decision_map = {

    '2': do_something_else,
    '3': do_another_thing     
}
def decision_func(input_var):
    func = decision_map[input_var]
    func()

# same as...
decision_map[input_var]() # Gets the correct function from response_dict and calls it as a function using ()

# safer than eval() 
# Using a dispatch method is safer than other techniques, such as eval(), as it limits the commands allowable to 
# what you defined beforehand, e.g. hackers can't sneak a <DROP TABLE Students;>  injection past a dispatch table.

### List mutation: change/add/delete
""" lists are mutable (can be changed/appended) unlike strings, e.g. can't

# Change values in lists

# Add values to lists
square_list += "dog"  # Add "dog" to the list

# Append (add) new values to lists
mylist.append = <element_to_add>  # add a new element to the list
# e.g.
square_list.append("dog")  # append = add. Add "dog" to the end of the list ('append' mutates the old list, rather than creating a new list)
list1.append([7, 8])    #[1,2,3,4,5,6,[7,8]]    # inserts the new list [7,8] as an element in list1
square_list.append(2*round_list)  # append = add (not replace). This means multiply values in the round_list by 2 and add them to the square_list.


### Remove values from lists

# using the -= command
square_list -= "dog"  # Remove "dog" from the list

# using the remove command
mylist.remove()
# e.g.
mylist = ['dogs', 1, 'cats', 3, 'horses', 0, 'fish', 10, 'horses']
mylist.remove(1)  # Removes the number 1 from the list n (if it contained 1) - NOT the item at index #1

# using the Pop command .pop()
mylist.pop()    # mutates the list by removing and returning its last element (to show what it removed).
                # if the () parentheses are empty, it pops the LAST element in the list.
x = square_list.pop(1)  # removes the element at index #1 in square_list (pops it out) and saves it as 'x'

# using the Delete command del()
del(mylist[])
del(square_list[1])  # removes the item at index 1 from list n but does not return anything.

### Count number of occurences of an element in a list
mylist = ['dog', 'cat', 'horse', 'fish', 'horse']
mylist.count('horse') # number of occurences of the word 'horse'


### Completely empty a list - remove all elements from it
mylist.clear() # returns []


### Search in lists
# In
myvalue in mylist
print(3 in [1,2,3,4,5])    # will print True, as 3 appears in the list
print(6 in [1,2,3,4,5])    # will print False, as 6 does not appear in the list

# Not In
myvalue not in mylist
print(3 not in [1,2,3,4,5])    # will return False, as 3 appears in the list

# Example: check whether an element appears in a list; if yes, return the first index of the element in the list; if no, return -1.
def find_element(p, e):         # p = the list variable; e = the element variable
    if e in p:                  # uses the In command to return True/False if e appears in p or not.
        return p.index(e)       # uses the list.index() command to return the index number of e in p.
    return -1                   # otherwise (else:) returns -1. Didn't put 'else:' to reduce no. lines.
find_element([1,2,3,4,5], 3)    # 2 (index #2)
find_element([1,2,3,4,5], 6)    # -1 (not in list)

find_element(p, e)
a = [1,2,3,4,5, [6,7]]
a.index([6])

# sklearn is the key module for machine learning in Python.

### Data structure for sklearn
# sklearn requires all inputs to be numeric (no text)
# and arranged in a NumPy array (it won't accept dictionaries)

""" A python dictionary can't be read directly into an sklearn classification
    or regression algorithm; instead, it needs a NUMPY ARRAY or a LIST OF

### SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING

# HOW IT WORKS
""" You subset your dataset into training and testing data, fit (train) the
    algorithm using the training data, and test it by using it to make
    predictions about the testing data.

    # The training set comprises FEATURES and LABELS (unsupervised learning has only FEATURES):
    # Features = datapoints with measurements of one or more variable, e.g. height
        (can have multiple columns, e.g. gradient, bumpiness and speed limit)
    # Labels = the response/output/result/value/target/class associated with
        each datapoint, e.g. tall/short, fast/slow.

    # You test the algorithm by giving it a set of features (heights) to predict
      the labels for, when you already know the answers, e.g. tall/short; and
      then calculate the accuracy score to show how many preds are correct.

    # More training data generally gives you a better result (higher accuracy) than
    # a fine-tuned algorithm (Udacity Lesson 6 video 3).
    # So accuracy is more influenced by the size of the training set than the parameters.
    # Being able to use more data will almost always improve algorithm performance.

### Classification vs Regression
 """ Supervised learning is divided into two main categories:

# Supervised classification:
    # continuous or discrete inputs
    # discrete outputs (CLASS LABELS) - fast/slow, name, phone number, ID number
    # finds a DECISION BOUNDARY
    # evaluate using ACCURACY

# Regression:
    # continuous or discrete inputs
    # continuous outputs (NUMBERS) - continuous implies ordering, e.g. salary, height
    # finds a BEST FIT LINE
    # evaluate using the SSE or R-SQUARED
"""

### Common Supervised Classification algorithms (produce discrete outputs)

### (1) NAIVE BAYES
""" Good for text datasets, doesnt account for word order """


### (2) SVM (support vector machines)
""" More accurate than Naive Bayes
    Can produce non-linear decision boundaries
    Can be optimised using parameters including: kernels, gamma, and C
    Slow, especially for large, noisy datasets with many features (e.g. text)
    Speed up optimisation by using smaller training datasets.
    ## SVMs are called SVC in sklearn - support vector classifier """

# To take a subset of 1% of a training dataset:
features_train = features_train[:len(features_train)/100]
labels_train = labels_train[:len(labels_train)/100]


### (3) DECISION TREES
""" Allow you to ask multiple linear questions one after another.
    - Easy to use
    - Easier to interpret visually than SVMs
    - You can build bigger classifiers out of decision trees using ENSEMBLE METHODS.

    - Prone to overfitting, especially when using many features and/or small training sets.
    - Overfit decision trees would give high accuracy on training set and low on the test set.
    - Tune parameters to avoid overfitting, e.g. using min_samples_split: if nodes end up with just one
        datapoint you've almost always overfit.

    - Important to measure how well you're doing and stop the tree at the appropriate time.
    - Also play with the variance-bias tradeoff and the split criterion (entropy, gini...)
"""

### (4) K NEAREST NEIGHBOUR (KNN)
""" Widely used classification technique
    (Can also be used for regression).
    Easy to interpret output, reasonable predictive power and low calculation
    time (compared to e.g. random forest).

    HOW IT WORKS:
    Assigns a query point to the class most common among it's k-nearest
    neighbours in the feature space.

### A note about classification datasets
""" When generating / augmenting a dataset, be VERY careful if your data are
    coming from different sources for different classes.

    Introducing features that come from different sources depending on the
    class is a classic way to accidentally introduce biases and mistakes.

    E.g. different sources can contain missing values for different features,
    e.g. old weather datasets may be missing wind speed or have less accurate
    precipitation measures than new ones, suggesting that weather has changed
    over time (less rain or lower wind speed).
    (See note in Udacity intro to mach learn Lesson 6 quiz 35).

    One solution is only using features that appear with a similar frequency or
    accuracy in datapoints from all sources, e.g. temperature, and ignore
    features that vary with source, e.g. wind. """


### REGRESSION (produce continuous outputs)

# Output = slope * input + intercept    (y=mx+b)
# intercept=0 if line passes through the origin.

# fit and train regression
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
reg = LinearRegression()
reg.fit(features_train, labels_train)

# predictions
preds = reg.predict(features_test)  # where features_test is an array of shape = (n_samples, n_features)

# e.g. to predict the label of a new point [2, 4] (i.e. value for feature_1 = 2 and value for feature_2 = 4)
reg.predict([[2,4]])         # list of lists (one per point, despite there being only one point in this example)
# e.g. to predict the label of two new points
reg.predict([[2,4], [2,7]])
# e.g. to predict the label of a new point when the regression has only one feature, e.g. age
pred = reg.predict([[27]])
# NOTE: for regressions values to predict for must be in a list, even if there's only one value:
pred = reg.predict(27)  # won't work as 27 is not in a list.


# Evaluating regresssions
""" Assess the regression fit by:

# 1. Plotting the regression line over the scatter points
# 2. Examining some performance metrics:
     - the errors that the regression makes (measured as the sum of squared errors, see below)
     - the r-squared score (see below)
     - the regression coefficients (slope and intercept) - e.g. how they
        change when you regress on different variables/remove outliers.
"""

# Plotting regressions
plt.scatter(x,y)                # x=inputs, y=outputs
plt.plot(x, reg.predict(x))     # x=inputs, reg.predict(x)=inputs and predicted
                                # outputs from the trained regression algorithm 'reg'.

# e.g...
plt.scatter(ages, net_worths)                    # make a scatter plot of all data points
plt.plot(ages, reg.predict(ages), color="blue")  # draw predicted regression line
plt.show()


## The Sum of Squared Errors, SSE

""" Regression algorithms work by finding the slope and intercept that minimise
    the SSE (distance between each training point and the
    regression line, squared, and summed over all training points).

    Squared errors are used rather than absolute errors (SUM|error|) as there can
    be multiple lines that minimise SUM|error| but only one line will minimise SSE.
    (it's also computationally much easier to calc regression using SSE than SUM|error|)

    SSE is related to sample size!!
        - It increases as you add more data (each point adds to the sum of errors),
          but it doesn't necessarily mean the fit is worse.
        - This makes it hard to compare fits between different-sized datasets.
          (Udacity Intro to Mach Learn Lesson 7 video 29)

    Popular regression algorithms that minimise SSE:
        - Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) - used in sklearn LinearRegression
        - Gradient Descent
"""

## R-squared score (0-1, higher=better)

# Indicates how much variation in the output (y) is explained by variation in the input (x) """
# Popular metric for describing the goodness of fit of a linear regression.
# Not influenced by sample size (unlike SSE), so more reliable if dataset size could change.
# Calc as 1-u/v, where u=regression sum of squares and v=residual sum of sq.

print "TEST SET r-sq:", reg.score(ages_test, net_worths_test)  # for the test set
print "TRAIN SET r-sq:", reg.score(ages_train, net_worths_train)  # for the training set (for comparison)

# if there is overfitting going on,r-squared will be lower for the test set than the training set.

""" Best possible score is 1.0 and it can be negative (because the model can be
    arbitrarily worse). A constant model that always predicts the expected value
    of y, disregarding the input features, would get a R^2 score of 0.0. """

# in a Udacity quiz I got scores of:
# 0.85 - they said it was very good
# 0.046 - they said it was 'low, but could be lower'.
# -1.485 - they said it was a 'pretty bad score'.

### UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING

# The training set has only FEATURES and no LABELS
# So you have to find strucure in data without labels

# CLUSTERING

### K-MEANS CLUSTERING

# How it works
""" 1. Assign:
     - You pick a number of clusters and where their cluster center (centroid)
        is positioned (the initial position is just rough guess).
     - Then points are assigned to the centroid they are closest to.

    2. Optimise:
     a) update the centroids:
        - reposition the centroid closer to the centre of each cluster
    	    of points, by minimising the total quadratic distance (error)
     	    between the centroid and each of the points.
     b) reassign the points:
        - to their nearest centroid: some will change clusters.

    # 3. Repeat optimisation until points stop changing clusters.

### FEATURE SELECTION FOR MACHINE LEARNING
""" Good algorithms employ the minimum number of features required to get as much info as possible.
      (quality not quantity)

    ### Bias-variance tradeoff
    = goodness (VARIANCE, high N features) vs simplicity (BIAS, low N features) of the fit.
    - See <...Machine_Learning/ud120-projects/Bias-variance tradeoff.txt>

    ### Recommended Process for Feature Selection:
    1. Use your human intuition to choose a potential feature of interest
    2. Code it up
    3. Visualise the result (can use colour coding, e.g. colour the POIs red if you
       are trying to discriminate them from non-POIs. Look for clustering/patterns and
       decide whether the feature gives you discriminating power in the classification
       problem you are trying to solve. If yes, keep it.
    4. Repeat this process a few times to zero in on what you think will be the most
       helpful new feature for you.

    ### Reasons to exclude a feature from a model:
    - it's noisy
    - it causes overfitting
    - it's strongly correlated with another feature in the model
    - it adds complexity that slows the training/testing process (keep things simple!)

    # PRECISION rate = tp / (tp + fp) = 10/21 (21 is the col sum),

    # RECALL rate = tp / (tp + fn) = 10/16 (16 is the row sum),
        i.e. probability that a photo *of* George is identified as George, or
             the ability of the classifier to find all the positive samples.

    # High recall/low precision = high true positives, but risk of false positives.
        e.g. "Nearly every time a POI shows up in my test set, I am able to
        identify him or her. The cost of this is that I sometimes get some
        false positives, where non-POIs get flagged."

    # High precision/low recall = low false positives, risk of false negatives.
        e.g. "Whenever a POI gets flagged in my test set, I know with a lot of
        confidence that it¬ís very likely to be a real POI and not a false alarm.
        On the other hand, the price I pay for this is that I sometimes miss
        real POIs, since I¬ím effectively reluctant to pull the trigger on edge cases.¬î

    # Depends on project aims as to whether you want high precision or high recall.
      For Enron we want high recall/low precision as don't want to miss any POIs (false negs).

###  """ MODULES / PACKAGES / LIBRARIES """
# =============================================================================

# A module is a .py file containing Python definitions and statements.

# First install module via terminal using conda or pip
# advice: https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-install-Python-packages-in-Anaconda

# Then import the module or specific functions from it into Python

###

# Installing modules

# If you want to use pip: in Anaconda Command Prompt, cd to C:\Anaconda\Scripts, and use pip from there.

# To resolve difficulty importing certain modules in bash, do this in python:
import pip
pip.main(['install', "pytrends"])



# Download only the packages you want with the conda command (in Git Bash, not Spyder)
conda install PACKAGENAME
conda remove PACKAGENAME # to remove/uninstall it
# e.g. conda install pyflux

# can use pip instead of conda, but pip installs packages in a different place to conda, so can cause problems when trying to import them in python (py looks in the wrong place. Doesn't cause probs for all packages though, just textacy & spacy so far!)
pip install PACKAGENAME
pip uninstall PACKAGENAME


# Import module into specific python environment
# open cmd via the Anaconda Navigator (for common/official modules), by clicking play next to the required environment
# or type
conda install --name py36 numpy
# for info see: https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-pkgs.html

# NOTE for reference
# module cv2 = opencv


### Using conda to manage packages in Python (copied from txt file with same name)

# Conda is the package manager for Python in Anaconda
# pip is the package manager for Python if don't have Anaconda installed
# Use conda (and pip) commands on the cmd line

# To install a new package:
conda install PACKAGENAME		# enter this on the command line, not in Spyder/Anaconda.
e.g. conda install pyflux

# If it says 'invalid syntax' or the command is not recognised then conda needs updating.

# Conda must be updated via the cmd line using:
>>> conda update conda

# If this command is not recognised:
# Go to the ControlPanel\System\Advanced system settings\Environment Variables\Path
#   Then hit edit and add <C:\Users\User\Anaconda3\Scripts> to the end (this changes the filepath associated with 'Path' in the cmd line).
# Note the new path on S2DS laptop was: C:\Users\Client\Anaconda2\Scripts
#   Then restart the cmd line.
# I found these instructions on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44515769/conda-is-not-recognized-as-internal-or-external-command.



### Importing modules into Python

# import entire module
import math
# possible conflicting function names between modules, so must type math.function to specify which module a function is from, e.g.
math.sqrt() # square root function from math module

# Better to import specific functions only

# See all functions contained in a module:
import math             # Imports the math module
everything = dir(math)  # Sets everything to a list of things from math
print(everything)        # Prints the names of all the functions.

from math import sqrt # import a specific function
from math import sqrt, log # import 2 functions


# View module version
import numpy as np
np.__version__

# can also do this in git bash using pip
pip show packagename  # shows location, version and dependancies/dependents

###  """ NumPy """
# =============================================================================
# https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html

# NumPy¬ís array class is called ndarray.

# Create numpy array containing samples from a normal distribution (mean=0.0, SD=1.0)
# https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.random.normal.html
numpy.random.normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=None) # loc = mean, scale = SD


# Basic NumPy commands
ndarray.ndim    # number of axes (dimensions) of the array, e.g. arrayname.ndim
ndarray.shape   # dimensions of the array
                # For a matrix with n rows and m columns, shape will be (n,m)

numpy.reshape(a, newshape)  # reshape an array into a new shape without changing its data.
                            # a = array to be reshaped
                            # newshape = tuple of integers: (n_rows, n_columns).
                            # If newshape is just one integer then the result
                            # will be a 1D array of that length.

### """ OUTLIERS """
# =============================================================================
 """ See Udacity intro to machine learning: Lesson 8 Outliers.

 To identify outliers:
    # Plot the raw data as a scatterplot and use the raw data sheets to identify unusual values.
    # Fit regression and plot scatterplot with reg line to check the fit visually
    # Also check the r-squared value
        - If there are outliers decide whether to accept (fraud etc) or reject them.

 OUTLIER REJECTION
    # Method for outlier detection in machine learning regression:
    1. Train the regression algorithm (with the training dataset).
    2. Remove the 10% values with the highest residual errors (distance from reg line)
    3. Re-format the data (if necessary) and re-train the algorithm on the
        reduced training set. The R-Sq should be higher and the line should fit better..
    4. This train-remove-retrain procedure can be repeated.

    # Function I wrote to clean data by removing values with large errors:
        function outlierCleaner in the file outlier_cleaner.py in

#  Filling in strings using %
print("Her name was %s and she was %s" % ('Betty', 'beautiful'))

### Searching/finding within strings (CASE SENSITIVE)
searchstring.find(targetstring)    # targetstring = the substring to find
# e.g.
sentence = "I have a dog"
print sentence.find('dog')    # output is index of the FIRST occurence of the word 'dog' within 'sentence' (9)
# If the target string is not found then the result is '-1' which means False.
# So when using if statements on search results, differentiate positive/negative results using:
if result == -1:
    # OR:
if result:
# Both of these statements mean "if result is False"

# CASE SENSITIVE: e.g. print sentence.find('Dog') would return -1 as 'dog' is all lowercase in the sentence.

# Search string after a given index position
print sentence.find('dog', 5)   # searches for the first occurence of dog after position 5. If dog started at position 4 it would return -1. If it started at position 5 it would return 5. If the sentence was 'my dog ate a dog' then although the first occurence is at position 3, the first occurence AFTER position 5 is at position 13.

# Example: to extract a URL from html code of a web page (from Udacity intro to comp sci course):
    # 1. find the location of the (first) URL/link on the page
start_link = page.find('"', '<a href=')  # <a href= is the link tag at the start of each clickable link on a html web page, e.g. <a href="http://www.google.com"
    # 2. find the start of the link
start_quote = page.find('"', start_link)    # finds the first quotation mark after the start_link
    # 3. find the end of the link
end_quote = page.find('"', start_quote+1)  # finds the first quotation mark after the start_quote, i.e. the second quotation mark. start_quote+1 ensures the quote excludes the quotation mark (as index 0 = character 1 etc).
    # 4. save the full link
url = page[start_quote+1:end_quote]


### Split string into a list
# This separates words in strings - not perfect as doesn't separate out punctuation such as ',' or '!'
# so 'dog!' wouldn't show up if I searched for 'dog'.
sentence = "I have a dog!"
sentence.split() # using the default delimiter, which is a space s.split(' ')
# returns ['I', 'have', 'a', 'dog!']
sentence.split()[0]  # view the first word in sentence

### Join elements of a list into a string
'delimiter'.join(a)
# e.g. to join elements of list a
a=['Hello', 'World']
' '.join(a) # returns 'Hello World'


### Strip whitespaces from strings
a = ' Mug '
a.strip() # returns 'Mug'


# iterate through words in a string
for word in sentence.split():   # <for word in sentence:> would print each character, not word.
    print word

# Remove key words from a string using str.replace()
blacklist = ["have ", "a ", "!"]
for word in blacklist:
    sentence = sentence.replace(word, "")
print sentence  # returns <I dog>

# Use triple quotes for long quotes over multiple lines:
quote = """I have a dog, I have a dog, I have a dog, I have a dog,
I have a dog, I have a dog, I have a dog, I have a dog! """
quote.split()

### Convert strings to numbers and back
ord(<string>)  # converts a one-letter string to a number ('a' = 97, 'b' = 98, 'A' = 65, 'B' = 66). Numbers are based on ASCII character encoding.
# !! ord only works on one letter strings!!
# NOTE: ord(str(<number>)) treats the str(number) as a 'string' so ord(str(1)) = 49 rather than 1.

chr(<number>)  # converts a number to a one-letter string
# ord and chr are interchangeable, e.g. chr(ord('a')) = 'a' and ord(chr(1)) = 1

# to print a string in a nice format
print("%s" %query)

###  """ TUPLES """
# =============================================================================
""" A tuple is a comma-separated list of values.
    Values stored in a tuple can be any type, and they are indexed by integers.
    Unlike lists, tuples are immutable.

    Tuples are comparable and hashable so we can sort lists of them and use
    tuples as key values in Python dictionaries.

    Although unnecessary, it's common to enclose tuples in parentheses () to
    help people identify them in code. """

t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')

# To create a tuple with a single element, you have to include the final comma:
t1 = ('a',)
type(t1)    # returns <type 'tuple'>
            # without the comma it would evaluate to a string.


## Sort a list of tuples
mytuplist = [('app', 121, 4),('ban', 231, 3),('car', 148, 2), ('dat',221, 1)]
# key = function that identifies the thing to sort by.

# use sorted() to return the sorted list without changing the original
sorted(mytuplist, key=lambda x: x[1]) # x[1]=sort by 2nd value in each tuple (in index position 1)

# use list.sort() to sort the list and save it in the new order.
mytuplist.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])

## Alternatives to lambda
# itemgetter
from operator import itemgetter
sorted(mytuplist, key=itemgetter(2)) # x[2]=sort by the 3rd value in each tuple.

# a self-defined function
def mysortfun(a):
    return a[1]   # to sort by 2nd element
sorted(mytuplist, key=mysortfun)


# =============================================================================
###  """ VARIABLES """
# =============================================================================

# variable names must start with a letter or underscore, but can contain any combination of letters, numbers and underscores
# variable names rarely start with capital letters.

# Assign a value to a variable using '='
a = 5     # assigns the value 5 to the variable 'var'


### Aliasing

# variable names refer to objects; sometimes multiple variables refer to the same object
# e.g. if you create a variable 'animals' to refer to a list:
animals = ['tiger', 'lion', 'zebra']
# and then 'make a copy' of the list using the following code:
new_animals = animals
# Both animals and new_animals refer to the same object: they are aliases - different names for the same list.
# Lists are mutable (numbers aren't - can't change 3 to 4 as that would be too confusing!)
# So changing the list that animals refers to also changes the list that new_animals refers to. E.g. if 'James Bond' dies, so too does 'Agent 007'
animals[1] = 'hippo'    # changes 'lion' to 'hippo' in the animals list
new_animals[1]     # is now also 'hippo' instead of 'lion'
new_animals[2] = 'seal'     # changes 'zebra' to 'seal' in the new_animals list
animals[2]  # is now also 'seal' instead of 'zebra', because animals refers to the same object/list as new_animals.


### Making copies of mutable variables such as lists

# to make a separate list called new_animals that is a TRUE COPY that won't also be affected by changes to the animals list, reassign the original string to the new_animals variable
new_animals = ['tiger', 'lion', 'zebra']
new_animals[0] = 'chimp'  # changes the first element of new_animals from 'tiger' to 'chimp'
animals[0]    # the first element is still 'tiger' because this time animals refers to a different object to new_animals.



### Multiple assignment

value_1, value_2 = newvalue_1, newvalue_2     # can assign any number of variables in one line, as long as the number of values matches the number of newvalues and they're in the right order.
# e.g.
a,b = 1,2    # this assigns a=1 and b=2
a,b = b,a    # means 'a should equal b and b should equal a' so their values are swapped.

# can also use functions/procedures for multiple assignment, e.g. if function <def get_url(page):> returns two outputs (url and endpos), you can assign these outputs to new variable names thus:
url, endpos = get_url(page)

# To specify what to return in functions with multiple outputs:
# e.g.when using if statement in function that returns two outputs:
if result:  # this means if the result is True, exists or is anything other than False/empty/None.
    return None, 0  # This returns "None, 0" for the two output values if result is False, e.g. if a find() command returned nothing.





# =============================================================================
###  """ WHILE LOOPS """
# =============================================================================

# While means 'as long as', so will continue to loop while the statement is true
# syntax:
while <TestExpression>:
    <block>     # keeps going as long as the TestExpression is True
                # as soon as the TestExpression is False, Python goes to the next expression.

# Instead of a test expression such as <while result = True>, can just say:
while True:     # this keeps the while loop going as long as the if statement in the block below is True.
    if blah > 5:
        return x
    else:
        break

# Be careful of infinite loops!!!
# E.g. the loop below will run forever, because i will never equal 10:
# i = 1
# while i != 10:    # = as long as i is not equal to 10, run the block below
#     i=i+2         # adds 2 to i each time, so returns 3,5,7,9,11 and skips 10.
#     print(i)

# Example while loops
while list_name:    # equivalent to 'while len(list_name)>0' / 'as long as the list is not empty'.
    <block>
    # opposite to while list_name: is while not list_name: (i.e. as long as the list IS empty)
while a < b:
    <block>
while a not in b:
    <block>
